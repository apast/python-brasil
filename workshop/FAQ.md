# FAQ
- What is an event? GitHub Events are notifications that GitHub can send apps to notify them of changes on GitHub. Changes include things like: new commits pushed, new issues opened, CI checks failing, really anything that can happen on GitHub can be reported as an event to your app. This means our actions don't have to constantly ask for new updates, updates can be pushed to our actions as they happen. Events are sent to your app over webhooks, which is an HTTP endpoint that you provide, like an API endpoint, and that GitHub calls to pass your app information. Learn more about [which webhooks are available](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows) in our help-docs.
